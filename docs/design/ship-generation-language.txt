Ship Mesh Generation Language:
------------------------------
Includes:
	#files containing reusable materials, planes, faces
Materials:
  Id: color, metalness, specularity, roughness, gloss, emissivity?, refractiveIndex?
Planes:
  XY: XY   #x@0 y@0   (vertical plane facing the camera)
  TiltedPlane: X@10Y@45
  TranslatedPlane: XZ-5   #translated in the y direction
LOD0:
  Faces:
	  Transom: 
		Material: x
		Plane: XY  (or another face)
		Subtractive: false #if true, removes part of the face.
		Points: 
			1: a,b 
			2: c,d
			3: e,f
			4: Mirror #3 about {plane}
			5-7: Rotate #4 about {point on plane}  (repeats for each point id)
		Normals:  #by id or array (array wraps around point count)
			1:
			2:
			#if no normals defined, will use plane normal for all points
		or
		Other ways of defining points:
			1, 3-5:  Reflect $Transom/1-4 across {plane}  #clone  points from other face
			2: g,h   # insert a new point at a specific position
			6-8:     #Reflect 1-4 across {plane} @clone points from this face using reflect
			9-12: 	 #Rotate 1 about X+nY+m  clone points from this face using rotation.
					  # if point counts dont match, will use a "wrap" approach to clone
			13-14: 	 $transom/13-14 
		#Last point in path always closes path to first point
		
		AnotherFace:
			Reflect $Transom about {plane}  #clone using reflection.
			or
			Rotate $Transom about X+10Y+10  #clone face using rotation.
					#axis defined like a plane but is a translation of the origin axis
			or
			Translate $transom Z-10			#clone face using translation
LOD1: 		
	Faces:
		#if face has same Id as earlier LOD, earlier face will be invisible/replaced
		#face can be null, in which case it will be invisible and not replaced
		#or faces can be used as "planes"
