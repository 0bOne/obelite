  use: Orbital Station
  blurb: The Coriolis Station is the standard Cooperative orbital station seen in almost all systems. A kilometre across, with room for over a hundred ships and tens of thousands of inhabitants, these stations are key trading hubs for their systems, as well as housing several police Viper patrols.
