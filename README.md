# obelite

A browser-based loose clone of the Open Source game Oolite. 
Ver much an early work in progress.

Compatibilty:
- Runs on most up-to-date desktop browsers if the hardware supports WebGL2 (https://webglreport.com/?v=2)
- Not expected to run on most mobile devices, but let us know if it does
